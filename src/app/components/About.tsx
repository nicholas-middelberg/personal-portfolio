        <p className="section-text">Welcome, I’m Nick! I’m a software engineer and senior at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Human Centered Design. My favorite work is being involved in the entire product lifecycle, from generating ideas and creating a robust design, to bouncing ideas off of teammates, to writing and shipping efficient code. I’m a firm believer in constant learning, which means I’m always looking to expand my technical knowledge or consider a new perspective. 

In my spare time, I enjoy being out in nature, training boxing, cooking for others, playing puzzle games, and learning how things work on the internet.
